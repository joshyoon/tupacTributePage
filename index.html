          <h3>10 Interesting Facts About Tupac:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Although his West Coast appreciation indicated otherwise, Shakur was born in East Harlem, New York, on June 16, 1971.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Shakur’s real name was Lesane Parish Crooks.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Afeni Shakur was an active member of the Black Panther party. Tupac Shakur was born one month and three days after Afeni had been acquitted of charges of “Conspiracy against the United States government and New York landmarks.”</strong></li>
            <li><strong>When he was 13, he played Travis Younger in A Raisin in the Sun, which was performed at the Apollo Theater in Harlem to raise funds for Jessie Jackson’s presidential campaign.</strong></li>        
            <li><strong>He attended Baltimore School for the Arts, where he took ballet classes. He also played the role of The Mouse King in the Nutcracker.</strong></li>        
            <li><strong>Shakur, under his new stage name Makaveli, completed The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory in seven days, using three days to write and record the songs and four days to mix the album.</strong></li>      
            <li><strong>Shakur was supposed to play a lead role in Menace II Society, but after an altercation with co-director Allen Hughes, he was replaced with Larenz Tate.</strong></li>        
            <li><strong> He was a Shakespeare aficionado.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Before the whole East Coast vs. West Coast beef, Tupac and Notorious B.I.G. were actually friends.</strong></li>    
            <li><strong>Me Against the World hit number one on the Billboard 200, making Shakur the first artist to accomplish this feat while serving a prison sentence.</strong></li>
